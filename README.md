# Classifying Folksongs Project

## Overview

woop woop woop
This project is an investigation whether or not extracted featuers of melodies can be used to train some sort of ML classifier.
The idea is to explore a bit with it and then write it up into a small paper for the Journal of New Music Research.
The big goals of the project are

* Get small publication in JNMR
* Learn about various ML classification methods 

## Tasks 

### Current

* [X] Redownload Essen Collection with All Countries
* [X] Rerun Feature Extraction Script
* [ ] Get American Folk Songs from Kodaly
* [ ] Get Meertens Dutsch Folk Song (Peter Von Kranenberg?) 
* [ ] Convert RS200 Melody to Krn

### Literature Review

* [X] Start Overleaf with JNMR Requirements on page
	LINK FOR JNMR http://www.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?journalCode=nnmr20&page=instructions
* [ ] Find 15 Sources related to Essen Folk song and categorization (aka cited by Shanahan NA paper) 
* [ ] Write Outline of narrative based on previous research
* [ ] Clearly state what the goals and implications of the research will be

### Methods

#### Data

* [X]  Get Essen Collection Features 6210
* [ ] Get American Features http://kodaly.hnu.edu/collection.cfm 522
* [X] Chinese Features?
* [X] Write R Script to Add in More Humdrum Metadata (Like German Region) 

#### Analysis 

* [X] Create Cleaning Script of Extracted Features
* [ ] Write rationale why ML method of choice will be used in accordance with Hypotheses
* [ ] Create charts based on classification findings 

### Discussion 

* [ ] Wait until Introduction and Methods have been written.

	* Converted densmore collection after dinner
3. Added in ESAC region information Thu Jan 11 13:04:30 
	* Added R code to add in region information for essen
	* Also created columns for subsetting of Densmore Collections
4. Emailed Kodaly Center again, set up outline for paper 
5. Started Exploratory Script Friday Jan 19 11:45:30
	* Get full Essen from DS
